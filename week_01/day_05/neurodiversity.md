> Masking is an artificial performance of social behaviours that are seen as more socially acceptable in a neurotypical society

Ableism is something neurodiverse people face every day.
Typically burn out faster, face bullying, underempoyed and more.

## Don't!

- Don't treat neurodivergent people based on assumptions or stereotypes
- Not all neurodivergent poeple are the same
- Your experiences are not the same as ours
- Can come off as dismissive
- Some neurodivergent people do something called 'pinging'. This is where one trues to show they relate to a persons story by telling a related story of their own. Are you trying to relate, or being dismissive?
- Of course offensive words in any context, like 'retard' or using OCD can be exclusionary and belittling

## DO

- Listen to neurodivergent people
- Stay curious, keep learning.
- Don't dismiss or belittle
- Research before supporting things like 'lighting it up blue for autism'. These are sometimes people or charities (such as Autism Speaks) trying to find cures for autism.
