## Week 1 of CodeClan in review


My first week at CodeClan was incredible, with a primary focus on Python. The days breakdowns were as follows:



| Day | Concepts covered |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Monday | Command Line practice, and starting on Python concepts |
| Tuesday | Python Conditionals, Loops, Lists, Tuples and Dictionaries |
| Wednesday | Python Functions and Passing unit tests |
| Thursday | Empowering your learning and Debugging |
| Friday | Neurodiversity presentation and an introduction to the weekend project |

- Primary Challenge this week: Paired programming, and discussing concepts to other developers.
- Primary Strength: Surprised myself with Passing Unit Tests. It seemed initially quite daunting, but once I understood the concept, it fell into place quite easily.
